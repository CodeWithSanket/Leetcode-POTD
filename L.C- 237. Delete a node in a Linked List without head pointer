Approach-1: 1. Place the extra pointer "temp" on the node which is to be deleted from the linked list. 
            2. Now Try replacing the temp->data with next node value and perform these operations until nextNode Pointer -> next == NULL.
            3. Now delete the last node

Time Complexity: O(N)
Space Complexity: O(1)

CODE:
  class Solution
{
    public:
    //Function to delete a node without any reference to head pointer.
    void deleteNode(Node *del_node)
    {
        Node* t1 = del_node;
        Node* t2 = t1->next;
        
        while(t1 != NULL && t2 != NULL && t2->next != NULL) {
            t1->data = t2->data;
            t1 = t2;
            t2 = t2->next;
        }
        t1->data = t2->data;
        t1->next = NULL;
    }
};

2. Approach-2: Just replace the Current node with Next Node 

Time Complexity: O(1) 
Space Complexity: O(1)

class Solution
{
    public:
    void deleteNode(Node *del_node)
    {
       *del_node = *del_node->next;
    }

};
