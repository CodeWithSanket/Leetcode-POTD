Approach-1: Sort the given array and apply condition 
            1. If the last element is equal to limit variable, then it means only single person can stay in boat.
            2. Apply Two Pointer Approach to solve the problem.

class Solution {
public:
    int numRescueBoats(vector<int>& people, int limit) {
        sort(people.begin(),people.end());
        int s = 0, e = people.size()-1;
        vector<vector<int>>vec;

        while(s <= e) {
            while(people[e] == limit) {
                vector<int>v;
                v.push_back(people[e]);
                vec.push_back(v);
                e--;
            }
            int sumWeight = people[s] + people[e];
            vector<int>v;
            if(sumWeight == limit) {
                v.push_back(people[s]);
                v.push_back(people[e]);
                s++;
            }
            else if(sumWeight < limit) {
                v.push_back(people[s]);
                v.push_back(people[e]);
                s++;
            }
            else  {
                v.push_back(people[e]);
            }
            vec.push_back(v);
            e--;
        }
        return vec.size();
    }
};
